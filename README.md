# CHEME7770-prelim1

 Handwritten solutions are in "jhp265-prelim1.pdf", while R markdown file contains the code for the rest of the solutions. 
 The R markdown can be viewed in the "PaekJ-Prelim1.pdf" file, or the original code can be viewed in "PaekJ-Prelim1.rmd". 
 The Excel spreadsheet where I performed non-linear least squares regression (explained in the R markdown) is included.
